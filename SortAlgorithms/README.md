Sort Algorithms Comparison Notebook
=============================

This is an analysis on time of some sorting and selection algorithms. I'm making this basically to help people have a better understanding on the time of some algorithms, in a real time performance analysis.

I hope this could help anyone studying Big-Oh Notation to better understand the time complexity, of this algorithms. If you want me to add any new algorithm, please give a request.

P.S: This Notebook, is also an excuse for me to learn this amazing tool, iPython, and hopefully a little bit of LaTex.
